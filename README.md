# PHOPHO 2022

### About

PHOPHO is a planned upcoming competition which aims to promote an interest in physics among members of the PSHS community. The competition will take place during YMSAT of SY2021-2022 and will be facilitated by various members of the PYHS.

### The CMS

The content management system (CMS) for PHOPHO 2022 is custom-built and in-development. If you wish to contribute to the project, contact one of the developers listed below.

You can currently visit the site by clicking [here](http://official-pipho.epizy.com/), although it will be migrated to a better hosting platform as soon as the site is finalized.

##### Initial Plan

The CMS manages two types of user account: admin accounts and participant accounts. The former possesses privileges which allow them to modify the database storing various resources and PHOPHO data. The latter are users taking part in the competition, and have access only to the lower-level functionalities of the site. Note that a teaming system is yet to be implemented for the site.

##### Canva Draft

The interface of the CMS is currently being drafted via canva. The link to the initial design of a handful of pages may be visited [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEicz5DcKQ/P2l9i94m9-8gskJTZl8umw/view?utm_content=DAEicz5DcKQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton).

##### Progress

* ##### v0.1.0

Currently, a rudimentary UI has been implemented, and the login system functions as needed. Users may also register, although input validation has not been implemented.
Restrictions on accessing admin-level functionality has also been implemented, and user sessions function with basic access to the site. However, logging out is currently impossible.

* ##### v0.1.1

The Admin Control Panel has been updated and now displays a users panel; information on every 15 users is retrieved per api call. The account page was added and drafted, and dialog boxes have been implemented in js.

* ##### v0.1.2

Logging out is now functional, and admin users can now change user priviliges. User accounts may also be deleted via admins. The account and registration pages have also been removed from circulation (they have been hidden).

* ##### v0.1.3

A preloading animation was added to ensure a better user experience (it looks rather disgusting viewing raw html before all the css/js have loaded in).

* ##### v0.1.4

The theme of the site has been updated and now follows the scheme depicted [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEicz5DcKQ/P2l9i94m9-8gskJTZl8umw/view?utm_content=DAEicz5DcKQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton).

### Problems

The problems included in the competition will be drafted by members of the PYHS. However, contributors may refer problems to any one of our members; these may then be included after further perusal.
